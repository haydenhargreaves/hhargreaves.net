The system will use small microphones and microcontrollers to detect drone sounds, even amidst background noise, at distances of at least 50 feet. This data will be collected by a network of weather-resistant, solar-powered sensors, transmitted wirelessly via LoRa and WiFi, and securely reported in real-time to Amazon Web Services for monitoring. This project is a research project funded by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and the Undergraute Research Institute (URI).",

## Create Journal Posts

To create a new post, all you must do is create a new markdown file in the `./src/journal/` directory.
However, before you begin writing, you must first add the following two lines at the top of the 
new markdown file:

```markdown
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Desc: Some short description to post on the index page of the journal.
```

Below this, you can write your journal post in the markdown format. The metadata above is used for 
displaying and parsing the post.
